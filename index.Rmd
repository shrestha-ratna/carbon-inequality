### Abstract
> The partisan divide over climate change issues has posed a substantial hurdle to implementing a unified climate policy in the U.S. Here, I employ the Shapley value decomposition approach to measure the partisan gap in state-level per capita energy-related CO2 emissions. Despite a decrease in overall carbon emissions and stable per capita carbon inequality between states (measured by the Gini index), the inequality between ‘red’ and ‘blue’ states widened over the period between 1997 and 2021. Throughout the period, the divide by political color was more pronounced than that by many other dimensions, such as income, climatic condition, and geographic location. Driven primarily by disparity in coal use for electricity generation, the partisan gap was worse in 2021 than in 2020. While the partisan gap intensified, the carbon distribution changed from being top-concentrated to bottom-concentrated between 1997 and 2019, only to be reversed in 2020 and 2021.
