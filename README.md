### Abstract
> The partisan divide over climate change issues has been a major hurdle in implementing a unified climate policy in the United States. Here, we apply the Shapley value decomposition approach to measure the partisan divide in state-level energy-related per capita CO2 emissions. We find that the population-weighted (unweighted) inequality between red and blue states as a share of overall inequality between states, measured by the Gini index, increased from 37.30% (38.24%) in 1997 to 57.20% (58.21%) in 2021. Throughout the period, this divide by political color was more pronounced than that by many other dimensions such as income, climatic condition and geographic location. Driven primarily by the disparity in coal use in electricity production, the partisan gap worsened more in 2021 than in 2020. While the partisan divide worsened, the carbon distribution changed from top to bottom concentrated between 1997 and 2019, just to be reversed in 2020 and 2021.
